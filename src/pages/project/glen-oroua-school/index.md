# Role: 
Sole Developer [Glen Oroua Website](http://www.glenoroua.school.nz/)

Involved in development of multiple sites as a developer for Hothouse, I was requested to build a simple easy to navigate site for Glen Oroua School. The focus was being accessible for parents with various technical abilities.

The site was built from a mobile first approach and includes an events calendar, gallery, and multiple children and staff blogs using taxonomy.

## Technologies
PHP, Silverstripe, MySql
